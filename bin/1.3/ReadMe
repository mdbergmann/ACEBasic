Workbench 1.3 Compatibility
===========================

The files in this directory are Workbench 1.3 compatible versions of ACE:bin
files. If you are using Wb 1.3 copy these files to ACE:bin.

The 1.3 version of 'bas' uses a68k and blink instead of vasm/vlink.


Building 1.3-Compatible Libraries
---------------------------------

The default runtime libraries (db.lib, startup.lib) are built with vasm which
produces hunk format symbols that are incompatible with the old blink linker
used in Workbench 1.3.

To build libraries compatible with a68k/blink for use on Workbench 1.3:

1. Edit src/make/Makefile-lib

2. Change the ASFLAGS to include -kick1hunks option for vasm:

   ASFLAGS = -Fhunk -kick1hunks

   Or alternatively, use a68k instead of vasm for assembly:

   AS = a68k

3. Rebuild the libraries:

   cd ACE:src/make
   make -f Makefile-lib clean
   make -f Makefile-lib

The -kick1hunks option restricts vasm output to symbol types valid in
Kickstart 1.x, making the libraries compatible with blink.

Note: The ami.lib library does not need rebuilding as it uses the original
format that is compatible with both toolchains.
