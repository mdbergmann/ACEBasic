I recently received these files in the mail (snail-mail) from Petr Kucera in the 
Czech Republic and thought others might wish to see them. The programs center
around the use of an include file he wrote (I've renamed it from Includes.h to 
Petr.h).

Petr's code was written with ACE v1.02 (I have sent him ACE v2.3!). Even though some
of his efforts have been superceded by more recent versions of ACE, his code is still
of interest.

In particular, some may benefit from Petr's Using$ function which approximates the
PRINT USING statement which I have yet to implement in ACE (it's on the list!). I 
have written a short example program (test.b) which uses this function. Petr wrote 
a program, aptly named example.b, which demonstrates other features of Petr.h. See 
Petr.h for details of each subprogram.

Enjoy.
