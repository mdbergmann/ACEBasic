Phase 3 (Documentation) -- Implementation State
=================================================
Date: 2026-01-27
Status: COMPLETE

Files Modified
--------------
1. docs/ref.txt
   - Added BIND entry (alphabetically between BIN$ and BLOCK)
     Covers: syntax, value-capture semantics, heap allocation via ACEalloc,
     memory behaviour, string capture limitation, example, cross-references.
   - Added INVOKE entry (alphabetically between INSTR and INT)
     Covers: syntax, statement and expression usage, raw pointer vs closure
     dispatch, type-checking when @SubName linkage exists, examples of
     statement/expression/closure/callback usage, cross-references.

2. docs/ace.txt
   - Added "Function Pointers and Closures" section between Subprograms
     and Structures (starting at approximately line 1380).
     Subsections:
       * Function Pointers -- @SubName into LONGINT/ADDRESS variables
       * INVOKE -- Indirect Calls -- statement and expression forms
       * Passing Function Pointers as Parameters -- callback pattern
       * BIND -- Value-Capture Closures -- partial application
       * Creating Closures Inside SUBs -- value capture semantics
       * Closures as Callbacks -- passing closures to other SUBs
       * Memory Behaviour -- ACEalloc lifecycle, loop accumulation warning
   - Added page markers (page 22, page 23) within new section
   - Renumbered all subsequent page markers (old 22-50 -> 24-52)
   - Updated Table of Contents to include new section entry
   - Added Limitation #12 covering closure memory accumulation and
     string capture-by-address behaviour

3. docs/ref.guide
   - Regenerated from ref.txt via txt2guide.rb
   - BIND and INVOKE nodes present with cross-reference links

4. docs/ace.guide
   - Regenerated from ace.txt via txt2guide.rb
   - "Function Pointers and Closures" node present in main menu

Content Documented
------------------
- INVOKE variable(args) -- syntax, usage as statement and in expressions,
  return value behaviour, calling convention selection
- BIND(@SubName, args) -- syntax, closure record lifetime, value-capture
  semantics, partial application
- Passing function pointers and closures as SUB parameters
- Limitations: no reference capture, no individual free, memory growth
  if closures created in loops, string capture by address
- Examples: function pointer basics, callback pattern, partial application,
  closure returned from a SUB, closure passed as callback

Remaining Follow-Up
-------------------
- CHANGELOG.txt could be updated to mention closures (INVOKE/BIND) as
  a new feature if a release is being prepared.
